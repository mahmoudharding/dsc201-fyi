    "## What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive tool for writing code, running it, making visualizations, and adding text or images—all in one place. It’s popular in data science for combining code with explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Edit mode**: Type or edit content in a cell.\n",
    "* **Command mode**: Manage cells (add, delete, move) but can’t edit content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel runs your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Idle (⚪)**: Ready to run code\n",
    "* **Busy (⚫)**: Running code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Code cells**: Run Python code.\n",
    "* **Markdown cells**: Add text or formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `[ ]`: Mot run yet (Idle)\n",
    "2. `[*]`: Running (Busy)\n",

    "1. A `SyntaxError` means there is something wrong with the structure of your code, and Python cannot understand or execute it as written. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The message \"incomplete input\" is telling you that Python reached the end of the code (or the end of the line) but didn't find what it expected to complete the `print()` function call. Here, the missing piece is the closing parenthesis `)`.\n",
